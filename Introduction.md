Hello, this is a repository to training TS and JS, I was in 2 technical interview and... it was ok but first I could not answer every single question, second the answers were no senior answer and finally I had to answer with examples directly and its ok but not for much questions so... lets start

## Themes
* JS
	* Asynchronous operations✅
		* Callbacks✅
		* Promises✅
		* Async/await✅
	* Difference between == and === ✅
	* Closures✅
	* null vs undefined
	* event loop
	* let vs const vs var
	* prototypical Inheritance
	* this
	* hoisting
	* method vs function
	* sync vs async
	* event delegation
	* Array
		* functions
